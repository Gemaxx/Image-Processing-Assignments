Assignment 1:
1. Write a Python function to read image using OpenCV
"Image"
2. Implement Histogram Equalization and Contrast Stretching
2.1. Implement Histogram Equalization
* Image before applying
* code
* Image after applying
	-Explore the changes in pixel intensity distributions through histograms before and after applying technique for image 

2.2. Contrast Stretching
* Image before applying
* code
* Image after applying
	-Explore the changes in pixel intensity distributions through histograms before and after applying technique for image 


3. Implement these Filters: Averaging, Gaussian, and Median
3.1. Averaging
* original images
* code 
* impact of filter on the original images

* images enhanced using histogram equalization
* code
* impact of filter on the images enhanced using histogram equalization

* images enhanced using contrast stretching
* code
* impact of filter on the images contrast stretching

3.2. Gaussian
* original images
* code 
* impact of filter on the original images

* images enhanced using histogram equalization
* code
* impact of filter on the images enhanced using histogram equalization

* images enhanced using contrast stretching
* code
* impact of filter on the images contrast stretching

3.3. Median
* original images
* code 
* impact of filter on the original images

* images enhanced using histogram equalization
* code
* impact of filter on the images enhanced using histogram equalization

* images enhanced using contrast stretching
* code
* impact of filter on the images contrast stretching

4. Explain any side effects introduced by the enhancement techniques and filters





Assignment 2:Image Edge Detection Using Derivative Filters
1. Read a grayscale image as input for edge detection
2. Implement Derivative Filters:
	Common filters include laplacian, Sobel, Prewitt filters.
3. Result Visualization:
	Display the original image and the edge-detected images using each filter side by side..
5. Comparison:
	Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each filter in terms of edge detection.

Note for Submission(PDF file):
The PDF should containing the code implementation,code must cover the entire implementation.
The PDF should containing Comparison.
